## Dive into the Code 🔍

Want to understand the backbone of this counter? Here's a breakdown:

### `document.querySelectorAll()`
Grabs all elements that match our criteria. For us, it’s all the buttons.

### `forEach()`
An elegant way to loop through items. Here, we're using it on the button NodeList.

### `addEventListener()`
How we keep an ear out for button clicks, attaching the magic behind each one.

### `currentTarget` Property
This gem helps us know which button was clicked, making our logic responsive to user actions.

### `classList`
A peek into the class attributes of an element. Used to identify which operation we're performing.

### `textContent`
Our bridge between the JavaScript logic and the user, updating the displayed counter value.
